    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>16 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>9 pounds boneless pork butt</li>
      <li>4 dried chipotle chili peppers</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>20 Roma tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>5 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>
      <li>Â¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>salt, to taste</li>
      <li>12 Mexican bolillo rolls, lightly toasted, cut in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>2 pickled jalapeno peppers, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C)</li>
      <li>
        Mix the 16 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of minced oregano, 2
        teaspoons of salt, and pepper in a bowl. Rub garlic mixture over the
        pork butt, and place pork in a shallow roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature
        to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue roasting until pork is tender
        and no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours and 15 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145
        degrees F (63 degrees C). Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum
        foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 20 minutes before rough
        chopping or shredding it. Reserve pan drippings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chipotle peppers in a bowl, and cover with hot water. Allow
        peppers to soak until softened, about 3 minutes; drain. Set aside. Heat
        the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in 8 cloves of
        minced garlic and the chopped onions; cook and stir until the onion has
        softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Roma
        tomatoes, 1 cup of water, chipotle chili peppers, 5 teaspoons of
        oregano, sugar, and salt to taste. Add the reserved pan drippings.
        Simmer, uncovered, over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring
        frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the chipotle sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than
        halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen
        towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
        the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until
        smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick
        blender and puree the sauce right in the skillet. Strain the sauce
        through a sieve.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve: Hollow out the bottom half of each bolillo to make a shallow
        bowl for the chopped pork. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the chipotle
        sauce over the bottom of each roll, then arrange the chopped pork over
        the sauce. Top each sandwich with a couple slices of pickled jalapeno,
        followed by the top half of the roll. Pour about 1/4 cup of additional
        chipotle sauce over the entire sandwich.
