    <h2>Sliders Rule!</h2>
    <p>
      Sliders are the mini muffins of burgers, they are bite sized for some
      people and for others they are just the right size. Shout out to all the
      young kids!
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons Dijon mustard, divided</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, divided</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian bread rolls</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an
        11x7-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef
        and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
        minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in ketchup, 2 teaspoons Dijon
        mustard, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire, and garlic powder. Season with salt
        and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut rolls in half horizontally without separating each roll from one
        another. Place bottom halves in the prepared baking dish. Spread meat
        mixture on rolls, top with Monterey Jack cheese, and cover with roll
        tops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine butter, brown sugar, remaining Dijon mustard, and remaining
        Worcestershire in a microwaveable bowl; cover loosely and microwave
        until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Mix and pour mixture over the
        top of the rolls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake
        until cheese is melted and rolls are golden brown, about 10 minutes
        more.
      </li>
    </ol>
